## User Manual
### Overview
Upon launching the application, you will see the Home page, which displays the first 250 cryptocurrencies obtained from the CoinGecko API. There is also a text box where you can search for cryptocurrencies by their Name. On the left side, you will find a navigation menu for switching between pages and a button to toggle the application's theme (please note that the selected theme is not saved after closing the application).

### Home Page
The Home page provides an overview of the top 250 cryptocurrencies. You can use the search box to find specific cryptocurrencies by their Name. To navigate to a specific cryptocurrency's detailed information, click on its block (you might need to double-click).

### Cryptocurrency Details Page
When you click on a cryptocurrency block, a new page opens with detailed information about the selected cryptocurrency. You will find information such as current price, market data, and more. Additionally, there is a "Open in Browser" button that opens the cryptocurrency's official website in your default web browser. To return to the Home page, click the "Back" button.

### Converter
In the navigation menu, you can access the Converter page. By default, the converter displays Bitcoin as the currency to convert from and Ethereum as the currency to convert to. The currency data for the converter is obtained from CoinCap.
On this page, you can convert various cryptocurrencies and view brief information about their price changes. Enter the amount you want to convert in the provided text box, and the converted value will be displayed.

### API Request Limit Warning
Please be aware that excessive API requests may lead to rate-limiting by the API providers. If you make too many requests in a short period, you might encounter rate-limiting issues. If this happens, you may see an error message, and you will need to wait for a few minutes before you can continue using the application.
I recommend using the application responsibly and avoid making an excessive number of requests to ensure uninterrupted use.

Enjoy using CryptoApp to explore cryptocurrency information and perform conversions!
